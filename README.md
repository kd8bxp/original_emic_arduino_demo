# Original EMIC Arduino Test Code

Recently (in 2017) I was finally able to get my hands on the original Parallax emic, this is a test sketch, and some notes on what I learned.
Couldn't get this to work if SOUT was hooked up, and had some issues with the Arduino sending both a CR and LF - I may take what I learned here and make a libary- it will make things simpler I think.
I've included the documentation for the emic I found it somewhere online (and can't remember where now), Parallax looks like they removed support for this device.
